# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 📊

This repository demonstrates how to use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and data visualization in Python.

## 🔍 Overview
PCA is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. This project covers:
- Conceptual understanding of PCA
- PCA implementation using NumPy and Scikit-learn
- Visualization of high-dimensional data in 2D/3D
- Comparison of datasets before and after applying PCA

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Use Cases
- Dimensionality reduction
- Noise reduction
- Data visualization
- Preprocessing for ML models
